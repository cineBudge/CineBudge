                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>The CineBudge project was created by Deniz Tural and Umut Kucuk for the final examination of the Open Access and Digital Ethics course of the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge master's degree of Bologna University.
<br>We created our data set by gathering different data types from different sources about the cinema industry. The scope of the project is to provide legally and ethically clear, reusable, sustainable and updateable data sources free from prejudices and discrimination on the cinema domain.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The main objective of the project is the analysis of open access data sets and further reuse of the data, with the aim of perceiving moderately current understanding that is accessible and readable by both human and machine. 
<br>We chose cinema as the scenario of the study. Cinema is an important part of the cultural heritage and one of the main industry that affects masses. Accessing cinema data as 5-star open data will contribute firmly to the development of the field as well as many educational studies and commercial events to be conducted on the field.
<br>In order to explore further on cinema and to enrich our research, we collected our data sets from different sources on topics such as budget, box office, admission, language, co-production, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    In addition to being accessible, the quality of the content is equally important. Specifically, there are some criteria that determine the quality within this domain. According to the Open Data Goldbook for Data Managers and Data Holders guide, these criteria are Content quality, Timeliness and Consistency.<br><br><strong>The UNESCO Unstitute for Statistics (UIS):
</strong><br>The UIS maintains its data to enhance public access. The UIS makes every effort to ensure the accuracy or completeness of the information about its data. One of the main goal of the UIS is to keep its data timely and accurate.
<br>It provides an user guide. In this context, the user manual provided for the purpose of accessing data can be regarded as an extremely positive aspect. However, there is a serious problem with the visualization of data. Since the technology used for this purpose is based on adobe flash player and this technology is not supported anymore, it is not possible to visualize the data. Data is available in English and French, in CSV and XML formats. The data was last updated in 2019. Data on the field of cinema ends in 2017.
<br>The UIS dictates that: "The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) encourages to use UIS data to benefit yourself and others in creative ways. You may extract, download and make copies of the information contained in the datasets, and you may share that information with third parties. You may also use our application programming interfaces (“APIs”) to facilitate access to the data, whether through a separate Web site or through another type of software application."
<br><br><strong>Lumiere Vod
</strong><br>LUMIERE VOD is a directory of European works (film and TV content) available on on-demand services in Europe. Find the services and countries where a film or a TV content is released on VOD, and combine search criteria to create lists of available films by director, country or year of production and available TV content by country of production.
<br>Lumiere VOD states that every care has been taken to ensure accuracy. "Our goal is to keep this information timely and accurate."
<br>Lumiere VOD, managed by the European Audiovisual Observatory, is supported by the CREATIVE EUROPE programme of the European Union.
<br><br><strong>Lumiere</strong>
<br>The LUMIERE database was created by the Observatory in co-operation with national information sources and the European Community MEDIA Programme. The Observatory has taken maximum care to verify the accuracy, quality and validity of the information contained in the LUMIERE database. In particular, the sources of information it has selected are generally considered trustworthy by experts in the respective countries.
<br>The data base LUMIERE provides a systematic compilation of available data on admissions of the films released in European cinemas since 1996. The data base is the result of the collaboration between the European Audiovisual Observatory and the various specialized national sources as well as the MEDIA Programme of the European Union. <br>
<br><strong>European Audiovisual Observatory</strong>
<br>The European Audiovisual Observatory's mission is to gather and distribute information on the audiovisual industry in Europe. The Observatory is a European public service body comprised of 41 member states and the European Union, represented by the European Commission. It operates within the legal framework of the Council of Europe and works alongside a number of partner and professional organizations from within the industry and with a network of correspondents.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Wikidata</strong><br>Constantly updating information and data in Wikidata perfectly match with the timeliness. However it is consistency questionable because it is based on the crowd collaboration, and there is not any specific organization that checks the quality of the data. All information in Wikidata can be displayed in any language, even if the data originated in a different language.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>UNESCO
</strong><br>On 9 October 2009, UNESCO established an Ethics Office to assist and provide advice to the Organization and its personnel on ethics and standards of conduct and thus to promote an ethical organizational culture based on UNESCO’s core values of integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity. The Ethics training and the Anti-harassment workshop are mandatory and delivered in person to all employees of UNESCO, regardless of their contractual status, worldwide. The Ethics Office also developed an online Ethics training.
<br><br><strong>European Audiovisual Observatory
</strong><br>European Audiovisual Observatory was set up in order to reply to a distinct lack of information and transparency concerning in audiovisual industry. The Observatory has a legal department that analyses key legal issues linked to the audiovisual sector and reports on major legal developments and ground breaking cases which affect media legislation in Europe. Legal department also provides support on ethical issues and supervises sustainability in this domain.
<br><br><strong>Our World in Data</strong><br>The goal of Our World in Data is to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable. "Our World in Data is about Research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems." The main goal of the organization is to provide sustainable, reusable, bias-free, transparent data.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Wikidata</strong><br>Wikidata is a free, collaborative, multilingual, secondary database, collecting structured data to provide support for Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, the other wikis of the Wikimedia movement, and to anyone in the world.&nbsp;Wikidata is a central storage repository that can be accessed by others, such as the wikis maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation. Content loaded dynamically from Wikidata does not need to be maintained in each individual wiki project. For example, statistics, dates, locations and other common data can be centralized in Wikidata.Wikidata is an ongoing project that is under active development. More data types as well as extensions will be available in the future. You can find more information about Wikidata and its ongoing development on the Wikidata page on Meta.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>According to our purpose, one of the most important points of the project is that the project can be updated actively or inactive. As we know, the emerging economic activities, social diseases and problems can easily affect the cinema industry. For this reason, we aimed to update our project by adding new data every year. Our project is based on command in terms of sustainability. We can update the documents updated by the institutions every year by adding them to our website in new years.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>DCAT</strong> is an RDF vocabulary for representing data catalogs. DCAT is based around six main classes.<br><br><strong>dcat:Catalog</strong> represents a catalog, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource; the scope of <strong>dcat:Catalog</strong> is collections of metadata about datasets or data services.<br><br>
                <strong>dcat:Resource</strong> represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalog. This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent class of <strong>dcat:Dataset</strong>, <strong>dcat:DataService</strong> and <strong>dcat:Catalog</strong>. Member items in a catalog should be members of one of the sub-classes, or of a sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of dcat:Resource defined in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application. <strong>dcat:Resource</strong> is effectively an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resource. <strong>dcat:Dataset</strong> and <strong>dcat:DataService</strong> can be used for datasets and services which are not documented in any catalog.<br><br>
                <strong>dcat:Dataset</strong> represents a dataset. A dataset is a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent. Data comes in many forms including numbers, words, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be collected into a dataset.<br><br>
                <strong>dcat:Distribution</strong> represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.<br><br>
                <strong>dcat:DataService</strong> represents a data service. A data service is a collection of operations accessible through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.<br><br>
                <strong>dcat:CatalogRecord</strong> represents a metadata item in the catalog, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the item and when.<br><br>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    To ensure clear understanding of the data and make it more accessible to ordinary users, we have produced 5 interactive visualizations distributed as follows:<br>

                    A geomap map, which is a map showing the average of cinema ticket prices between 2013 and 2017, using a color scale. It is possible to view data from 2013 to 2017.<br>

                    It is possible to see the bar chart of the same data below.<br><br>

                    A GeoMap map, which is a map showing the average budget spent by European countries on cinema between 2013-2017 through a color scale. Again, it is possible to view this data from 2013 to 2017. And in addition, the same data can be displayed as a pie chart.<br>


                    In order to draw attention to the decline of cultural activities such as cinema and theater after the pandemic, the embedded map prepared by Our World in Data institution with Google Chart can be actively viewed. The map that is based on all countries is the Choroplets map. Data from February 17, 2020 to February 20, 2021 are stable.<br><br>

                    Finally, when it comes to movies, we wanted to draw attention to the movies released between 2017-2020 with the sparql query query we made from Wikidata. In addition to our embedded map, both bar chart and different display features can be accessed.<br><br>

                    We also consider the movies and visualize them through a chart. Using Google's Bubble Chart library, we created the top 10 films that grossed the most from the European Union between 1996 and 2020.
                    All graphics were created in Javascript using the open source Google GeoMap library. Additionally, the open source d3.js library is used for charts.<br><br></p>
